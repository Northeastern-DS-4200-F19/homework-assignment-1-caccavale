            I was trying to get this to work in class -- if the bar chart represented precipitation levels you could show it this way.
            I was trying to get the bars to invert the color on the canvas behind them.  It would probably be busy but it might look cool.
            The rain/snow is something I made in the past and hosted on <a href="caccavale.github.io">my website</a>.
            I couldn't get the `backdrop-filter: invert(100%);` style to invert the canvas but I believe its a limitation of CSS/canvas interactions.

        <h3>I won't stop trying though!</h3>

            PS I didn't really follow the tutorial super strictly but I hope the css in ./styles/style.css is sufficient to demonstrate I understand the content.
            Sorry!

            PPS I'm super excited for this class.  I'm a super visually focused, computer science major and this is my first data science class.
            I've done a little work with <a href="https://caccavale.github.io/snowplow-syracuse/">weird JS stuff (snowplow routes)</a> and some
