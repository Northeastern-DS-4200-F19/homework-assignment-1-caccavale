            I was trying to get this to work in class -- if the bar chart represented precipitation levels you could show it this way.
            I was trying to get the bars to invert the color on the canvas behind them.  It would probably be busy but it might look cool.
            The rain/snow is something I stole from my <a href="https://github.com/mattrberry/javascript-snow-rain">roommate's github</a> real quick.
            (His was based on <a href="http://caccavale.github.io/">mine!</a>)
            I couldn't get the `backdrop-filter: invert(100%);` style to invert the canvas but I believe its a limitation of CSS/canvas interactions.
        </p>
        <h3>I won't stop trying though!</h3>

            PS I didn't really follow the tutorial super strictly but I hope the css in ./styles/style.css is sufficient to demonstrate I understand the content.
            Sorry!

            PPS I'm super excited for this class.  I'm a super visually focused, computer science major and this is my first data science class.
